# photo-share-app

An Instagram clone with a simple, clean interface focusing on photo sharing, commenting, and liking features. The color scheme should be inspired by Instagram's iconic blue and white, with a modern twist to the font styles for a fresh look. The layout will include a navigation bar at the bottom for Home, Search, Upload, Activity, and Profile sections, similar to the Instagram app. Key features include a grid layout for displaying photos, individual post pages, user profiles, and the ability to follow other users.
